CLEAN UP REQUIRED:

The following directories and files should be removed to fix the 403 deployment error:

1. Remove entire /supabase/functions/server/ directory - contains incorrect .tsx files
2. Remove these extra files from /supabase/functions/make-server/:
   - auth-service.ts
   - database-repository.ts
   - kv_store.ts
   - ml-service.ts
   - models.ts
   - mrv-service.ts
   - project-service.ts
   - routes.ts
   - CLEANUP_NEEDED.txt

3. Keep only these files in /supabase/functions/make-server/:
   - index.ts (main Edge Function)
   - deno.json (configuration)

4. Remove /supabase/functions/_shared/ directory as it's not needed

This will create a clean, minimal Edge Function structure that should deploy successfully.
